# Corona Simulation
**Guide:** Change the given "infect" method to do each task.

**Input is always:** matrix, an infected location (row, column)
## Task 1
Output: All infected locations ("[connected component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory))" of the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)))
## Task 2
Output: All infected that originated from the input, ordered by time of infection
## Task 3
Output: The complete chain of infection b upto patient zero (has value 1)
## Task 4
Output: Location of patient zero in a faster way (always pick minimal neighbour)
